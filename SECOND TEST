Creating a simulation to model the interactions between water, nuclear decay, evaporation, volcanic activity, 
and tectonic plate movement over a year-long global flood, particularly from a theoretical perspective such 
as the Catastrophic Plate Tectonics (CPT) model, involves various complex factors. The interactions between 
heat absorption, cooling mechanisms, and the heat energy from nuclear decay require multiple stages of 
calculations, assumptions, and simplifications for clarity. I'll break down the elements involved in this 
calculation and offer a step-by-step analysis of whether the system would resolve the "heat problem" by 
stabilizing the climate and preventing a runaway greenhouse effect.

1. High Specific Heat Capacity of Water and Heat Absorption from Nuclear Decay
Water has a high specific heat capacity (around 4.18 J/g°C) compared to most other substances, meaning it can absorb large amounts of heat without a significant increase in temperature. If we hypothesize a year-long global flood, water would need to absorb heat from multiple sources, particularly from accelerated nuclear decay due to the assumed catastrophic events.

Assumption:

Amount of water in the global flood: We assume the global flood involves a significant increase in the Earth's water, say 10^21 grams of water (approximately 1000 times Earth's current ocean mass).

Heat from nuclear decay: According to some estimates, radioactive decay on Earth releases about 30 TW of heat energy continuously.

Time period: 1 year (365 days).

To calculate the total heat energy absorbed by the water over a year:

𝑄 = 𝑃×𝑡

Where:

Q = total heat energy absorbed (in joules)

P = power released by nuclear decay (30 TW = 30 × 10¹² W)

t = time (365 days = 31,536,000 seconds)

𝑄 = (30×10^12)×(31,536,000)≈9.46×10^20 J

2. Effect of Water's Specific Heat Capacity

Given the enormous amount of water absorbing this heat, we can estimate the temperature change (Δ𝑇) of the water using the formula:

𝑄 = 𝑚×𝑐×Δ𝑇

Where:

m = mass of water (in grams, 𝑚 = 10^21 grams)

c = specific heat capacity of water (4.18 J/g°C)

ΔT = change in temperature (°C)

Rearranging to solve for Δ𝑇

ΔT:

Δ𝑇 = 𝑄

𝑚×𝑐

ΔT = m×c
 
Substituting the values:

Δ𝑇 = 9.46×1^20 ​
 
Δ𝑇≈0.23°C

Thus, the temperature of the water would increase by approximately 0.23°C over the course of the year from the heat generated solely by nuclear decay.

3. Impact of Salt Content on Specific Heat Capacity

Saltwater has a lower specific heat capacity than pure water. For seawater, the average specific heat capacity is around 3.9 J/g°C instead of 4.18 J/g°C for pure water. 
This means that seawater would absorb more heat for a given temperature change, but it would still absorb only a small fraction of the heat compared to the total amount released by nuclear decay.

For the calculations, the temperature increase in saltwater would be:

Δ𝑇saltwater = 9.46×10^20×3.9 ΔTsaltwater = 10^21×3.9≈0.24°C 

ΔTsaltwater≈0.24°C

Thus, even with salt content, the temperature change would still be quite small and unlikely to cause a runaway effect.

4. Evaporation of Heated Water and Heat Relief
Heated water leads to evaporation, which in turn leads to the loss of latent heat. The latent heat of vaporization for water is 2260 J/g. 

The rate of evaporation is influenced by the temperature of the water, wind, and atmospheric conditions. If we assume that a significant portion of the heat is lost through evaporation:

Assuming 10% of the heat is lost via evaporation (an estimate based on real-world conditions):

𝑄evaporation = 0.10×9.46×10^20 J = 9.46×10^19 J

Qevaporation = 0.10×9.46×10^20

J=9.46×10^19 J

This energy would cause a large amount of water to evaporate. The amount of water evaporated:

𝑚evaporated = 𝑄evaporation/𝐿
​ 
Where:

L = latent heat of vaporization (2260 J/g)
𝑚evaporated = 9.46×10^19/2260≈4.18×10^16g (approximately 41.8 billion tons of water)

This evaporation would reduce the amount of heat retained by the water, providing a cooling effect.

5. Tectonic Plate Movement and Volcanism

In the CPT model, accelerated tectonic plate movements lead to increased volcanic activity, releasing 
both heat and particulate matter into the atmosphere. Volcanic eruptions can cool the Earth by releasing aerosols that reflect sunlight and promote cooling through a volcanic winter effect.

The amount of heat generated by volcanism would depend on eruption frequency, size, and intensity, which is difficult to quantify directly but can be assumed to counteract the warming. 
Assuming increased volcanism releases 10^22 J over the year in total heat, we could compare this against the heat absorbed by the water:

Total heat absorbed by the water from nuclear decay: 

9.46×10^20 J

Heat released by volcanism: 10^22 J

The volcanic heat release would likely offset the heat absorbed by the water, potentially stabilizing the global temperature or even cooling it.

6. Runaway Greenhouse Effect Prevention

Increased volcanism would likely prevent a runaway greenhouse effect by releasing particulate matter that reflects sunlight, promoting cooling. 
The combination of the Earth's high specific heat capacity (from the water), the cooling effect from evaporation, and the volcanic aerosols would 
create a balance to prevent the extreme heating needed for a runaway greenhouse effect.

Conclusion

High specific heat of water can absorb a significant amount of heat from nuclear decay, resulting in a temperature increase of only ~0.23°C over the year.
Evaporation would provide additional cooling, removing heat through latent heat of vaporization. Around 41.8 billion tons of water would evaporate over the course of the year.
The CPT model's increased volcanism would release enough aerosols to counteract any potential greenhouse warming by reflecting sunlight, thus preventing a runaway greenhouse effect.
Salt’s effect on specific heat reduces the temperature rise slightly but still does not result in a significant temperature increase.
Tectonic movements could contribute to heat generation, but volcanic cooling mechanisms would likely balance out this effect.
In total, this model suggests that the heat problem would be largely resolved due to a combination of water's high heat capacity, evaporation cooling, and volcanic cooling. It would not lead to a runaway greenhouse effect under the assumptions used here.
